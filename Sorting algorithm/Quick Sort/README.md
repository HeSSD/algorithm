Quick sort is a very useful sort algorithm. Here I have used two different methods to realize quick sort respectively. However, when using java to realize it, it is not as good as we thought. The first one (i.e. quickSort.java) will overflow the stack while the second one will not, thus illustrating the instability of quick sort (at least in java)
